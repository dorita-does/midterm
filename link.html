		<h3>A study of gender bias in Disney Movies</h3>
		<p>My research focus on how Disney mostly showcases male characters than female characters in their films. For my Visualizing Data class with Sarah Slobin my fall semester at The New School, I decided to take upon this subject for my midterm project. I grew up seeing these movies, they served a big part of my early education and I hope they will be part of my children's lives too. My favorite princess was Cinderella, and later changed to Jasmin, and then Pocahontas. I loved every story, I lived every story. My sixth birthday was princess themed, and I requested all my friends dress up as their favorite princesses to join me for an afternoon of tea and crowns; I of course dressed up as my favorite, Cinderella. I was invested in the fantasy. Nonetheless, it had not come to my attention that even though little girls tend to identify with the female characters in these movies, the male characters are in most of the protagonists roles - way more often then women: twice as much, with a ratio of 24:12.</p>

		<h3>Visualizing Data: Violent Crimes Reported by Police in NY State</h3>
		<p>I was drawn to the index showing crimes reported by police in the New York area - considering I have just moved here. I was relieved to find that violent crimes, including murder, rape, robbery and assault have decreased greatly from 2016 to 2017 (being the lowest in 10 years). It was surprising to see that 2012 was the year where most violent crimes occurred. Luckily, it was also the year Obama went into office, and crime rates went down exponentially following that.</p>
